## Introduction

This is a project to predict the survival of passengers on the Titanic. The dataset is from Kaggle and can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data). The dataset contains 891 rows and 12 columns. The some columns are:

* PassengerId: Passenger ID
* Survived: Survival (0 = No, 1 = Yes)
* Pclass: Ticket class (1 = 1st, 2 = 2nd, 3 = 3rd)
* Name: Names of Passengers


This project is divided into 3 parts:

1. Data Exploration
2. Data Cleaning
3. Predictive Modeling

SVM is used for the predictive modeling, an accuracy of 0.83 is achieved.
